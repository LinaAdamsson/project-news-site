# News Site

The task was to create a responsive newspaper or magazine site, containing a header with logo and navbar, a news section and a grid with other news displaying four cards in a row for desktop, two for tablet and one for mobile.

## The problem

I started with the concept of the page, thinking about a theme suitable for being displayed in a grid. I used the videos and example projects provided by Technigo together with a lot of Googling.

I went about this from a design and concept point of view and I will definitely approach the next task differently. Now I know a bit more about how time consuming some parts will be and the importance of reaching a working system before putting information in it. I spent too many hours thinking at the start of this and I am nowhere NEAR where I envisioned I'd be. But I learned so much. If I had more time I would delve into the design and style the page, at this point however I'm just glad I got it to work â€“ somehow, at least.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
